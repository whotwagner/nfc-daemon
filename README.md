# nfc-daemon
nfc-daemon is a very simple event daemon that reads out the UID of nfc-tags and executes scripts.
It is based on nfc-poll.c from libnfc.

# Dependencies

* libnfc 1.8.0
* properly configured nfc-device

On Raspberry Pi OS:

```
apt update && apt install libnfc-bin libnfc-dev
```

# Installation

Compile:
```
make
```

Install:
```
sudo make install
```

As a systemd-service:
```
# BEFORE: edit docs/nfc-daemon.service and change User to your needs
sudo cp docs/nfc-daemon.service /etc/systemd/system/nfc-daemon.service
sudo systemctl enable nfc-daemon.service
sudo systemctl start nfc-daemon.service
```


# Configuration

nfc-daemon can be executed with the following parameters:
```
pi@raspi$ nfc-daemon -h
usage: nfc-daemon [-v]
  -v		 verbose display
  -h		 print help screen
  -t		 dry-run. no script-execution
  -l [0-4]	 use loglevel
```

Per default, nfc-daemon executes **/usr/local/share/nfc-daemon/run_script** 
when a nfc-tag is hold to the reader and **/usr/local/share/nfc-daemon/end_script**
on releasing the nfc-tag. 

# Example

The following sample shows the output of nfc-daemon with debug-loglevel:
```
pi@raspi$ nfc-daemon -l 4
